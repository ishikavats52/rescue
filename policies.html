        <h2>User Registration and Verification:</h2>

        <p>All rescue agencies seeking to join AppConnect must undergo a verification
            process to authenticate their legitimacy.
            Agencies are required to provide valid documentation,
            licenses, and references, which will be reviewed by our
            team before granting access.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Privacy:
        </h2>
        <p>We prioritize the safety and confidentiality of user data.
            Personal and agency information will be stored securely
            and will not be sold or shared with third parties without
            explicit consent.
            GPS location services are used purely for the functionality
            of the app and to aid in effective rescue operations.
        </p>

        <h2>Code of Conduct:
        </h2>
        <p>All users are expected to maintain professionalism and respect toward other agencies.
            Any form of misinformation, misrepresentation, harassment, or misuse of the platform
            will result in immediate suspension or termination of access.
        </p>
        <h2>Content Sharing:
        </h2>
        <p>
            While we encourage agencies to share their experiences and updates,
            all content posted should be relevant and accurate. Misleading or
            false information can result in content removal and account penalties.
            Images, videos, or any media shared should respect privacy rights.
            Ensure you have permission to share any content that features individuals
            or proprietary assets.
        </p>
        <h2>Use of Broadcast Feature:
        </h2>
        <p>The broadcast feature is designed for urgent situations requiring immediate
            attention or resources. Misuse or overuse of this feature for
            non-urgent matters can result in temporary or permanent restrictions.

        <h2>Collaboration and Dispute Resolution:
        </h2>
        <p>While we facilitate connections and collaboration, any agreements or
            partnerships formed through AppConnect are the responsibility of the
            involved parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            We encourage open dialogue and peaceful resolution of disputes.
            If conflicts arise, users can report them to our support team for assistance.
